# Sandify v1.2.2

## New Features

### Maze Shape

You can now generate traversable mazes in Sandify! Choose from four different grid types (Rectangle, Circle, Hexagon, or Triangle) and seven maze algorithms including Backtracker, Kruskal, Prim, and more. You can have the pattern draw the solution path or try to solve it yourself.

To try it out, select **Maze** as the layer Type.

### New Fractal Spirograph Types

We've added several new L-system patterns (Anklet of Krishna, Fractal Tree 6, Lévy C Curve, Terdragon). There are also 2 new options: one to let you add randomness with branch probability, and one that adjusts angle offsets.

To try it out, select **Fractal Spirograph** and then try out different types and options.

### Voronoi Effect

The Voronoi shape now has an effect counterpart! It will convert any pattern into a Voronoi diagram, with some pretty dramatic results.

To try it out, add an effect to a layer and select **Voronoi**.

### Internationalization

Thanks in large part to [@songfei](https://github.com/songfei) efforts, Sandify now supports multiple languages! We've added full Chinese translation support. To switch languages, go to the Settings tab and select a language (English or Simplified Chinese).

### New Fancy Text Fonts

The Fancy Text shape got a bunch of new fonts (Caveat, Fira Code, Montserrat, Permanent Marker, and Source Han Serif CN). Several fonts also have bold variants.
