// The basic idea of this algorithm is:
//   - Is the point out of bounds (oob)?
//     - Yes, then:
//       - Find the point along the line that intersects with the boundary (boundPoint). Add in that
//       point
//       - If the oob point is exiting at a corner, then insert the corner point.
//       - Next loop, find the point along the next line that comes from the oob point to the next
//       point. Add in that point.
//     - No, then:
//       - Keep that point.
//   - After preserving the shape as much as possible with the above, there are still some strange
//   cases where it will fail, like if the line segment is from oob left to oob right, so just clip
//   those to the nearestPoint.
